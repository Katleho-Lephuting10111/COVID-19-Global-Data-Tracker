# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A comprehensive data analysis project exploring global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations using real-world datasets and Python data tools.

---

## 📌 Project Description

In this project, learners will build a data analysis report or notebook that tracks the progression of COVID-19 globally. The goal is to:

- Clean and process COVID-19 data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends over time and across regions
- Generate meaningful insights through charts, maps, and narratives

By the end, you will have a well-documented data report suitable for presentation or publication.

## 🚩 Project Objectives

✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data  
✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)  
✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions  
✅ Visualize trends with charts and maps  
✅ Communicate findings using a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

## 🗂️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Collection

**Goal:** Obtain reliable COVID-19 data.

- **Recommended Source:** [Our World in Data - COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)
- **File to Use:** `owid-covid-data.csv`
- **Alternative:** Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 GitHub Repository

📥 **Action:** Download and place the CSV in your project directory.

---

### 2️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration

**Goal:** Load and explore the structure of the dataset.

**Tasks:**
- Load with `pandas.read_csv()`
- Check columns with `df.columns`
- Preview data using `df.head()`
- Identify missing values using `df.isnull().sum()`

**Tools:** `pandas`

📌 **Key Columns:**  
`date`, `location`, `total_cases`, `total_deaths`, `new_cases`, `new_deaths`, `total_vaccinations`, etc.

---

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning

**Goal:** Prepare data for analysis.

**Tasks:**
- Filter specific countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India)
- Drop rows with missing critical values
- Convert `date` to datetime format
- Handle missing values with `fillna()` or `interpolate()`

**Tools:** `pandas`

---

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Goal:** Explore COVID-19 trends and statistics.

**Tasks:**
- Plot total/deaths cases over time
- Compare daily new cases across countries
- Calculate and analyze death rates (`total_deaths / total_cases`)

**Visualizations:**
- Line charts
- Bar charts
- (Optional) Heatmaps for correlation analysis

**Tools:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

---

### 5️⃣ Visualizing Vaccination Progress

**Goal:** Analyze vaccine rollout across nations.

**Tasks:**
- Plot cumulative vaccinations over time
- Compare vaccinated population percentages

**Charts:**
- Line charts
- (Optional) Pie charts for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated

**Tools:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

---

### 6️⃣ (Optional) Choropleth Mapping

**Goal:** Visualize geographical spread using maps.

**Tools:** `plotly.express` (or `geopandas` for advanced users)

**Tasks:**
- Prepare a DataFrame with `iso_code`, `total_cases`, `total_vaccinations`
- Create a choropleth map showing density or coverage

---

### 7️⃣ Insights & Reporting

**Goal:** Summarize your findings.

**Tasks:**
- Write 3–5 key insights (e.g., "Country X had the fastest vaccine rollout")
- Highlight anomalies or surprises
- Use Markdown cells to provide explanations

**Deliverables:**
- Jupyter Notebook with:
  - Clean code
  - Visualizations
  - Narrative insights
- Optional: Export as PDF or PowerPoint

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Tools

- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code (with Jupyter extension)
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization
- (Optional) `plotly`, `geopandas` for interactive/maps
